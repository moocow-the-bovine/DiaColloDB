## DESCRIPTION

=head1 DESCRIPTION

DiaColloDB::Client::list is a subclass of
L<DiaColloDB::Client|DiaColloDB::Client> for
accessing a set of distributed L<DiaColloDB|DiaColloDB> databases
via a C<list://> URL whose path part is a space- or colon--separated list
of sub-URLs supported by L<DiaColloDB::Client|DiaColloDB::Client>.
It supports the L<DiaColloDB::Client|DiaColloDB::Client> API
by calling the relevant methods on each of its sub-clients.

new() options and object structure:

 ##-- DiaColloDB::Client: options
 url  => $url,       ##-- list url (sub-urls, separated with whitespace or ":")
 ##
 ##-- DiaColloDB::Client::list
 urls  => \@urls,     ##-- sub-urls
 opts  => \%opts,     ##-- sub-client options
 fudge => $coef,      ##-- get ($coef*$kbest) items from sub-clients (0:all; default=10)
 logFudge => $level,  ##-- log-level for fudge-coefficient debugging (default='debug')
 ##
 ##-- guts
 clis => \@clis,      ##-- per-url clients

The most important client parameter is the C<fudge=E<gt>$coef> option, which requests
that up to C<$coef*$kbest> items be retrieved from sub-clients for each L<profile()|profile>
call.  If C<$coef E<lt>= 0>, all collocates will be retrieved from each sub-client,
and trimming will be performed exclusively by the superordinate DiaColloDB::Client::list object.
The default value of 10 should return reasonable results without too large of
a performance penalty in most cases, but be aware that the results may not be strictly correct
due to sub-client local pruning.

Needs work for use in production environments, since the pruning semantics
for the C<kbest> request parameter are applied both by sub-clients
(modulo the C<fudge> client option) and must be re-evaluated after
integrating data from all sub-clients.  The current strategy is not strictly
correct, and should probably use the I<kbest(union(which(...)))> strategy
used by comparison profiles.
